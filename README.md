- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @am-ritas

**The title for your project is about:** My Personal Website
**A sentence on the purpose of the project:** Create my own personal website where I am able to showcase my future/current projects and accomplishments, especially in university.
**Goal:** By the end of this semester (middle of January), I would love to have finished my website and put any new accomplished/completed activities in it. I also have a goal of wanting to learn more languages so I will be really happy if I learnt the basics/intermediates of certain languages and programs that I will be using for this project.
**Technology used:** For my personal website, I will be learning a bit of HTML, CSS, and Javascript as well as Django and Streamlit on Python.
